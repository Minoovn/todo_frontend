# Task List Frontend

This is the **frontend** part of a simple task list application built as a course project for a Web Developer class.

## 📝 Note to Instructor

This is my **second attempt** at completing this project.  
After facing issues in my first try, I reviewed the structure and logic more carefully and successfully managed to finish it this time.  
I’m happy to say I now better understand how frontend and backend communicate through API calls.
